The shebang (#!) is a special character sequence at the start of a script that specifies the interpreter to be used for executing the script. It ensures that the script is executed by the correct program, such as bash, python, or perl.
Syntax:

#!/path/to/interpreter

Example:

    Bash Script:

#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a bash script"

This tells the system to execute the script using the bash shell.

Python Script:

    #!/usr/bin/python3
    print("This is a Python script")

How It Works:

    When you run the script (e.g., ./script.sh), the system reads the shebang line.
    It invokes the specified interpreter to run the script.

Why Shebang Is Important:

    Interpreter Selection: Specifies which program (e.g., bash, sh, python) to use.
    Portability: Ensures compatibility across systems where different shells or interpreters might be the default.
    Clarity: Makes it clear to others what kind of script it is.

If the shebang is omitted, the default shell (usually /bin/sh) will be used to execute the script.
