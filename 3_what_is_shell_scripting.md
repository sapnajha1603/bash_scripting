Shell scripting is the process of writing scripts, or small programs, using commands and constructs available in a Unix/Linux shell. These scripts are plain text files containing a series of shell commands that automate repetitive tasks, perform system operations, or manage workflows.
Key Features of Shell Scripting:

    Automation: Automates manual tasks like file manipulation, system monitoring, or backup processes.
    Simplicity: Easy to learn and use, leveraging commands already familiar to system administrators and users.
    Integration: Combines various commands and utilities to create complex workflows.
    Portability: Scripts can run across Unix/Linux systems with little modification.

Example of a Simple Shell Script:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
mkdir new_folder
echo "Folder created successfully."

This script creates a new folder and prints messages to the screen. Shell scripting is widely used for tasks like server management, application deployment, and system maintenance.
