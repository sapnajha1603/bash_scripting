A shell in Linux is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands. 
It acts as an interface between the user and the kernel, interpreting and running user inputs.
Types of Shells in Linux:

    Bourne Shell (sh): The original Unix shell, known for its simplicity and scripting capabilities.
    Bourne Again Shell (bash): An enhanced version of the Bourne Shell, commonly used for scripting and user interaction.
    C Shell (csh): Syntax resembles the C programming language, favored for its scripting features.
    Korn Shell (ksh): Combines features of the Bourne and C shells, used for scripting and programming tasks.
    Z Shell (zsh): A powerful shell with advanced features like auto-completion and customization.
    Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell): Focuses on user-friendliness with syntax highlighting and built-in help.

Each shell offers unique features and is chosen based on user preference or system requirements.
